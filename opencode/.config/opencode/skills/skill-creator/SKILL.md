## When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when:

- A pattern is used repeatedly and AI needs guidance
- Project-specific conventions differ from generic best practices
- Complex workflows need step-by-step instructions
- Decision trees help AI choose the right approach

**Don't create a skill when:**

- Documentation already exists (create a reference instead)
- Pattern is trivial or self-explanatory
- It's a one-off task

---

## Skill Structure

```
.agents/skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md              # Required - main skill file
├── assets/               # Optional - templates, schemas, examples
│   ├── template.py
│   └── schema.json
└── references/           # Optional - links to local docs
    └── docs.md           # Points to docs/developer-guide/*.mdx
```

## When to Use

{Bullet points of when to use this skill}

## Critical Patterns

{The most important rules - what AI MUST know}

## Code Examples

{Minimal, focused examples}

## Commands

```bash
{Common commands}
```

## Resources

- **Templates**: See [assets/](assets/) for {description}
- **Documentation**: See [references/](references/) for local docs

## Naming Conventions

| Type           | Pattern                    | Examples                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Generic skill  | `{technology}`             | `pytest`, `playwright`, `typescript`      |
| Project skill  | `{project}-{component}`    | `saas-api`, `saas-ui`, `saas-check`       |
| Testing skill  | `{project}-test-{target}`  | `saas-test-sdk`, `saas-test-api`          |
| Workflow skill | `{action}-{target}`        | `skill-creator`, `git-workflow`           |

---

## Decision: assets/ vs references/

```
Need code templates? → assets/
Need JSON schemas? → assets/
Need example configs? → assets/
Link to existing docs? → references/
Link to external guides? → references/ (with local path)

```

**Key Rule**: `references/` should point to LOCAL files (`docs/developer-guide/*.mdx`), not web URLs.

---

## Decision: Project-Specific vs Generic

```
Patterns apply to ANY project? → Generic skill (e.g., pytest, typescript)
Patterns are project-specific? → {project}-{name} skill
Generic skill needs project info? → Add references/ pointing to project docs
```

---

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field              | Required | Description                           |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Yes      | Skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens) |
| `description`      | Yes      | What + Trigger in one block           |
| `license`          | Yes      | Always `Apache-2.0` for sgc           |
| `metadata.version` | Yes      | Semantic version as string            |

---

## Content Guidelines

### DO

- Start with the most critical patterns
- Use tables for decision trees
- Keep code examples minimal and focused
- Include Commands section with copy-paste commands

### DON'T

- Add Keywords section (agent searches frontmatter, not body)
- Duplicate content from existing docs (reference instead)
- Include lengthy explanations (link to docs)
- Add troubleshooting sections (keep focused)
- Use web URLs in references (use local paths)

---

## Registering the Skill

After creating the skill, use the `skill-registry` skill to add it to the JSON registry:

```bash
# Extract name and description from the new SKILL.md (assuming it's in .agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md)
NAME=$(grep '^name:' .agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md | cut -d' ' -f2)
DESC=$(grep '^description:' .agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md | cut -d' ' -f2-)

# Add to registry using skill-registry commands
jq --arg name "$NAME" --arg desc "$DESC" '.skills += [{"name": $name, "description": $desc}]' .agents/skills/skill-registry/assets/registry.json > temp.json && mv temp.json .agents/skills/skill-registry/assets/registry.json
```

This integrates with `skill-registry` to automatically update the JSON registry with the new skill's details.

Optionally, also add it to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
| `{skill-name}` | {Description} | [.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md) |
```
