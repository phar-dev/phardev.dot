Load the git-master skill first, then:

Stage relevant files and create a commit with descriptive message following project conventions.
Analyze changes for appropriate commit type (feat, fix, refactor, etc.) and ensure atomic commits.

Follow git-master phases:
1. Style Detection - Analyze commit history for conventions
2. Branch Context - Check if safe to rewrite
3. Atomic Planning - Split by directory/concern
4. Execute with proper message format
